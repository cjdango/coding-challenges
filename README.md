# Counting minimum steps
Given an integer n, return the minimum steps to minimize n to 1

### Available steps
- Decrement n by 1
- If n is divisible by 2, then divide n by 2
- If n is divisible by 3, then divide n by 3

### Examples
- 10 => 3 steps (10 => 9 => 3 => 1)
- 15 => 4 steps (15 => 5 => 4 => 2 => 1)

### Solution
